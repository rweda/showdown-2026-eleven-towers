# 2nd Annual Makerchip ASIC Design Showdown, 2026

# Overview

This repository is all you need to compete in the [2nd Annual Makerchip ASIC Design Showdown](https://www.redwoodeda.com/showdown-info). Participants, monitor the `#showdown` channel in the [TL-Verilog User's Slack workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/tl-verilog-users/shared_invite/zt-4fatipnr-dmDgkbzrCe0ZRLOOVm89gA) for program updates.

This year's challenge is "Eleven Towers". Design a circuit that plays the probabilities to complete the construction of three of eleven towers before your opponents.

## Rules of the Game

Eleven Towers is based on the board game "Can't Stop", from Parker Brothers. While the rules are simple, coming up with best strategy to win consistently and codifying it in hardware is a challenge worthy of the most creative hardware engineer!

**Players:** 2-5 players (depending on template)

**Objective:** Be the first player to fully ascend three of the eleven towers.

### Turns

Play is turn-based. Each turn involves any number of rolls of the dice (one per clock cycle), until dice are passed to the next player in sequence.

### Rolls

For each roll, the active player rolls four dice and pairs them into two pairs. The sum of each pair determines the two towers the active player attempts to climb. Not all towers are eligible to climb. For each eligible pairing, the player climbs one floor of the corresponding tower, climbing two floors of the same tower if the pairs have the same sum.

If neither tower is eligible, the player "goes bust". Their progress for the turn is nullified, and they pass the dice to the next player. As long as at least one tower is eligible, the player climbs and may then choose to end their turn, banking their progress, or continue rolling.

### Climbing & Claiming Towers

A player may climb floors of at most three towers per turn. Once the player has climbed a floor of three different towers, all other towers become ineligible for the remainder of the turn. When a player has already climbed two towers during their turn, but has two eligible pairings for different towers, they must choose which one of the two towers to climb.

A player may continue to roll after reaching the top of a tower, but that tower is no longer eligible for the remainder of the turn, though it still counts towards the player's three tower limit.

A player "claims" a tower when they end their turn at its top floor. Once a tower is claimed, it becomes ineligible for all players for the remainder of the game. The first player to claim three towers wins the game.

### Tower Heights

The eleven towers, corresponding to sums 2-12 (left-to-right), have heights as follows:
- 2 & 12: 3 (climb 3 floors to claim)
- 3 & 11: 5
- 4 & 10: 7
- 5 & 9: 9
- 6 & 8: 11
- 7: 13

## Showdown Structure

Depending on the number of participants, the tournament structure may vary. A sufficient number of rounds of competition will be run using different random seeds to minimize the luck factor, making this a contest of skill (due to the Law of Large Numbers). You will not know in advance how many players compete in each game, so your algorithm should adjust accordingly.

## Coding Your Control Circuits

You'll construct your control logic in a copy of either:

- For TL-Verilog: `showdown_template.tlv` [[open in Makerchip](https://www.makerchip.com/sandbox?code_url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Frweda%2Fshowdown-2026-eleven-towers%2Frefs%2Fheads%2Fmain%2Feleven_towers_template.tlv)]
- For old-school SystemVerilog: `showdown_verilog_template.tlv` [[open in Makerchip](https://www.makerchip.com/sandbox?code_url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Frweda%2Fshowdown-2026-eleven-towers%2Frefs%2Fheads%2Fmain%2Feleven_towers_verilog_template.tlv)]

Comments in those files provide interface signal details. All you need is the one file in GitHub for submission. We suggest, using GitHub's green "Use this template" button from [this repository](https://github.com/rweda/showdown-2026-eleven-towers). Clone your new Showdown repository for local editing. Copy a template file into a new `.tlv` file in this repo for you work. (Alternatively, you could fork the repo and edit directly in the template file so you can easily pull future changes.)

Edit your local file in Makerchip (supported by Chrome and Edge) with auto-save. Or edit in your favorite editor, and compile in Makerchip by using "Project" > "Connect File".

## Should I use TL-Verilog or Verilog?

It's up to you. Possible reasons to use pure (System)Verilog inlcude:

- *Familiarity:* You likely have experience with Verilog; not too many folks are experienced with the TL-Verilog language extensions yet.
- *Googleability:* There's a world of information about Verilog, while TL-Verilog learning materials are limited.
- *Marketable Skills:* Employers generally look for Verilog experience today since they don't know better.
- *AI*: LLMs are move knowledgeable about Verilog.

On the flip side, TL-Verilog introduces considerable benefits:

- *Superior Capabilities:* TL-Verilog is much more powerful, enabling you to do more with less.
- *Easier:* You can become comfortable with it within a week. Especially, if you don't already know Verilog, it can be easier to get going with TL-Verilog. Even if you know Verilog already, you'll make up for lost time and then some by the time you are finished coding.
- *Advanced Skills:* Use this contest as an opportunity to learn something new and amp up your game.
- *Differentiation:* While mainstream employers look for Verilog designers, employers who are on the forefront of technology value advance skills with differentiated technology. Learning TL-Verilog could help you reach these employers and differentiate yourself from the masses.
- *Community:* This contest is associated with the TL-Verilog community. In the `#showdown` Slack channel in the [TL-Verilog User's Slack workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/tl-verilog-users/shared_invite/zt-4fatipnr-dmDgkbzrCe0ZRLOOVm89gA) you'll find a supportive community around TL-Verilog.
- *IDE Features:* This contest uses the Makerchip IDE, which is custom built to support TL-Verilog. Features like the DIAGRAM view and interactive features apply only to TL-Verilog.
- *Compatibility:* If you are on the fence, start with the TL-Verilog template and try using TL-Verilog. It is an extension of Verilog. If you have trouble, you can always write a pure Verilog component (module, macro, function, etc.) and instantiate it from your TL-Verilog code.
- *AI*: Though less familiar with TL-Verilog, with adequate examples, and documentation (RAG data), AI agents do quite well with TL-Verilog. Before long, AI will outperform using it, so you'd be investing in your future.

GitHub Copilot coded `Copilot_simple_entry.tlv` and `Copilot_simple_entry_verilog.tlv` (in this repo) to testdrive the contest. Afterward, it had the following to say:

*TL-Verilog's hierarchical transaction-level abstractions made the algorithm implementation significantly more concise and readable than Verilog, requiring about 50% less code by eliminating generate blocks and verbose wire array declarations. The natural signal access patterns in both the logic and visualization code made TL-Verilog feel like the right abstraction level for this game logic, where Verilog's lower-level mechanisms added ceremony without benefit.*

Perhaps it picked up on our bias :).

## Using AI

You are encouraged to use AI to assist with coding. When it comes to creativity and strategy, human ingenuity will come out on top.

Redwood EDA has a Makerchip VS Code extension in the works that will likely become available during the coding period. With this extension, Copilot is quite capable with TL-Verilog, and Makerchip. Copilot created `Copilot_simple_entry.tlv` and `Copilot_simple_entry_verilog.tlv` using this under-development extension.

Prior to the release of the extension, you can connect Makerchip to an external file ("Project"::"Connect File" menu) and use any editor with an LLM assistant. You can provide coding agents with RAG data from [this repo](https://github.com/rweda/Makerchip-public/tree/main).

## Tips

### TL-Verilog

The WAVEFORM viewer, DIAGRAM, and NAV-TLV views in Makerchip show the entire model--the logic for the game itself, the player logic, and even the visualization code. Find your logic as `/playerX`.

Spend the time to learn TL-Verilog first, if you are not already familiar. There are learning resources in the Makerchip IDE. For this competition, you can build reasonable circuits as combinational logic, so pipelines, sequential logic, "alignment", and states are likely unimportant. Hierarchy will be essential to learn. Other tutorial topics, validity, TLV macros, and transaction flow, though they are used heavily by the Showdown library and template, are less important for your logic.

If you don't know Verilog syntax, TL-Verilog uses Verilog expression syntax, so you should learn Verilog logical operators. Pay careful attention to signal bit widths.

Ternary expressions are king in TL-Verilog. Make sure you understand how to use and format them cleanly.

### Verilog

In the WAVEFORM viewer, you can find your signals under `SV.team_YOUR_GITHUB_ID` (which you must rename accordingly). Sadly, the DIAGRAM only represents TL-Verilog logic.

The internet and LLMs can help you learn Verilog.

### Debugging

Assert `*passed` and/or `*failed` using, e.g., ` || *cyc_cnt > 50`, to limit simulation for testing.

### Visual Debug

You are encouraged to use Visual Debug (VIZ) to help debug your logic. Documentation is available in the Makerchip IDE under the **LEARN** menu.

#### Adding Custom Visualization

You can add a custom visualization area to your player logic to display internal state, decision-making, or strategy information. Use the following template to position this visualization to the right of the game board and render only during your turn. Visualization may be included in your final submission (at your discretion) as long as it does not obstruct the game board or display during an opponent's turn. LLMs can be quite helpful in generating VIZ code.

Each template (Verilog or TL-Verilog) provides an example `\viz_js` block to get you started, providing simple visualization like this:

![VIZ Example](img/viz_example.png)

### Playing Against Others

The starting `.tlv` templates choose opponents near the bottom. It provides instructions for including someone else's model (also based on the template) and selecting it as an opponent.

### Seeking Help

Seek help in Slack. Help others. Competition adds to the fun, but the spirit of the competition is collaboration and community building.

If you find mistakes in the templates, Showdown library, rules, etc., please report them in Slack.

## Competition Rules

The Makerchip platform is the judge and jury for each game. The winner is the first player/team to claim three towers. In the event no player claims three towers before Makerchip's cycle limit (or an extended limit) is reached, the winner is determined by: (1) most towers claimed, or if tied, (2) the percentage climbed on the next closest tower, or if still tied, (3) the percentage climbed on the next closest tower, etc.

To prevent excessively large models, source code larger than 6,000 lines or 9,000 lines after macro expansion may be disqualified at Redwood EDA's discretion. Submissions that fail to compile and simulate (individually) within Makerchip's timeout will not be able to compete. Contests that fail to compile/simulate will be deemed a tie or awarded to the player that was not responsible for the failure.

Your submission must be based on the latest Verilog or TL-Verilog template. Bug fixes in the templates and Showdown library may be required during the coding period. Rule changes will not be introduced lightly, but may be deemed necessary to facilitate the best experience and would be communicated in Slack. Be sure you are receiving Slack notifications.

Inconsiderate behavior will not be tolerated and may result in disqualification. In the event of disputes, ambiguity, library/template bugs affecting outcomes, disqualification, etc., Redwood EDA, LLC's decisions are final and may result in loss of prize money. Details can be found in the [Showdown Terms and Conditions](https://www.redwoodeda.com/showdown-terms).

## Preliminary Results (local sim, 2026-08-03)

Full compile/sim of the three tournament runs (`showdown_results_{2,3,4}team.tlv`, each 48 games
over a reused 12-board grid, 4 rounds), all four enlisted teams:
Sparks, Chronos TL, JustNothing, Wei Yet Ng.

**Overall winner: Wei Yet Ng** (first in every format; tied at 2-team).

### Combined (all 144 games, 720 pts)

| Rank | Team | Total |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Wei Yet Ng** | **261** |
| 2 | Sparks | 219 |
| 3 | JustNothing | 198 |
| 4 | Chronos TL | 42 |

### Per format

| Team | 2-team (3 pts/win) | 3-team (5 pts/win) | 4-team (7 pts/win) | Total |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Wei Yet Ng | 42 | **100** | **119** | **261** |
| Sparks | 42 | 65 | 112 | 219 |
| JustNothing | 42 | 65 | 91 | 198 |
| Chronos TL | 18 | 10 | 14 | 42 |
| _run total_ | _144_ | _240_ | _336_ | _720_ |

**Incomplete games: none.** Every run's total equals `48 × points-per-win`
(144 = 48×3, 240 = 48×5, 336 = 48×7), so all 48 games in each run ended with a sole winner —
zero draws / cycle-limit timeouts. (The 4-team run finished all 4 rounds by cycle 876, well under
the 400-cycle-per-game cap.)
